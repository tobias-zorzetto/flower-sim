# Flower Simulation for calculating Carbon Cost

# How to run

install dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

define the configurations for the run in the file `src/config.yaml`. Below an example can be seen of a configuration:

```yaml

model: prajjwal1/bert-tiny
dataset: stanfordnlp/imdb
backend_config:
  client_resources:
    num_cpus: 8
gpu_backend_config:
  client_resources: 
    num_gpus: 1

clients:
  - cpu_time: 30
  - cpu_time: 20
  - cpu_time: 10

partitions: 10
```

In the example above, the model and dataset are set. It is also defined the number of cpus to paralellize the simulation or, if available, the number ofgpus.
In the end, the clients to be simulated are defined with their own metrics. More metrics can be added if needed. 
It is also define the number of partitions to ddivide the dataset.

**Finally, run the simulation:**

```shell
python src/simulation.py
```
